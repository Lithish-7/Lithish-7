## 🔐 About Me  

I’m a passionate cybersecurity & software enthusiast building tools, solving puzzles, and defending systems. My journey leans strongly toward **Blue Team / defensive security**, where I get to play the role of protector — detecting, responding, and preventing attacks.

- 🛡️ Focus Areas: **Log Analysis**, Threat Detection, Incident Response  
- 🐍 Tech: Python (primary), with experience in scripting, automation, and system tooling  
- 🔧 Tools & Topics: SIEM (Splunk / ELK), packet analysis (Wireshark), Linux hardening, security detection  
- 🌱 Always learning: malware analysis, memory forensics, reverse engineering
