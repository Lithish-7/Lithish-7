# 👋 Hi, I’m **Lithish (Phantrex)**  
**Aspiring Cybersecurity Engineer | Blue Team Enthusiast | Python Dev**

## 🧭 About Me  
I’m a self-driven security and software enthusiast on a journey to defend systems and build tools that make security easier. I thrive on solving challenges—whether in capture-the-flag contests, logging puzzles, or infrastructure misconfigurations.

- 🔍 Deep interest in **Blue Team / Defensive Security**, incident response, threat detection & log analytics  
- 💻 Proficient in **Python**, and working knowledge of **C++ / JavaScript / Go**  
- 🛠 Building & experimenting with security tools, honeypots, log scanners, and automation scripts  
- 🌱 Continuously learning new domains: malware analysis, forensics, reverse engineering  
- 🧩 I believe in “learn by doing” — open-source, collaboration, and sharing knowledge
